# Read This to run codes

Firstly you need to download node js
and then npm init
In my repository You can see An folder named as Store , In store You will find HTML codes You just need to copy that file and put it in global scope 
then you need to do npm run start in Terminal and it will run
And if anyone is facing issue Iam sorry this is actually first time i am using github u can connect me and tell me about issues , if i find any issue i will fix it
Thank You
